/*
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?
